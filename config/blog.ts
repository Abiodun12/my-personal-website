    content: `# Everything I Learned & Did From September to December — In Real Time

Published on: December 2, 2025

Last time I posted on here was September 2… it feels like ages ago lol. Since then, I’ve done a lot, lived a lot, and honestly discovered a lot about myself in the process.

The first few weeks of September were me recapping my summer and everything that happened—meeting new friends, getting my return offer from JPMorgan, meeting the guys I’m building BrewU with, and realizing I was stepping into a major transition period of my life. I still am. I’m starting a new job next year, finishing school with basically one class a week, and I’m blessed to be in a position where I don’t have to work right now just to pay my bills. That alone is something I’m grateful for, and I know I can be privileged. It’s something I’ll never take for granted.

## San Francisco — One of the Best Moments of My Year

I got invited to a panel discussion in San Francisco, and at first, I was low-key nervous. Days before the event, I kept thinking, “What am I even going to talk about?” 😅 But I stayed optimistic, did my research, trusted what I knew, and flew out.

I landed in SF, grabbed lunch with friends, showered, took a nap—and afterward, I felt energized. Confident. Ready.

I talked about my life, my views, AI, my story. I’m glad people found it interesting and relatable. Keep in mind, this was over 300+ people staring at this kid with a mic. Afterward, people came up to me, DMed me, and even Braven wrote me a handwritten letter. (If you want to get to my heart… write me a letter. I keep everything.)

That moment made me realize something: I’m in a place where if I ever needed a job, I genuinely feel like the connections I’ve made would get me in rooms most people pray for. Some roles wouldn’t even require an interview. And that means I’m doing something right.

Spending a few days in SF made me think: maybe I should travel more. I loved the culture there. Maybe I’ll live there for a bit someday. But NYC and Chicago still have my heart.

## Finishing September — Becoming a Real Engineer

September ended with me doing something huge: I built an entire app from scratch, alone. A real app. Database, backend, scraping pipelines, AI integration, clean UI—everything.

Going into it, I was optimistic like I always am (my mom drilled that into me). Even my co-founder had doubts about whether I could pull something like this off, but safe to say, the MVP is basically finished.

And honestly? Building this app was easier than I expected. But I learned so much—like, I swear I feel like a senior engineer and I haven’t even started my full-time job yet 😂.

Next year already has me excited. There’s so much happening behind the scenes—not just BrewU. I see myself growing into more community/branding/product solutions. (Shh… can’t give it all away yet.)

## The Uncertainty of Life — Something I’m Finally Accepting

One thing that’s been on my mind lately is just how uncertain life is. I’ve always known that, but maybe because my mind has finally had time to settle and rest, I’m finally feeling the weight of it.

I was talking to one of my successful friends and she told me she struggles with the same thing sometimes—how everything you have can change in an instant. How nothing is guaranteed.

I’ve always lived by this: Control what you can control, and the rest will fall into place. But also… sometimes luck is involved. That’s just real.

I’ve accepted it. This is how life will always be. Life is complex. Predicting the future is impossible.

So I’m heading into the uncertainty head-on, enjoying the ride, and focusing on what I can control. It’s given me so much peace. I didn’t come this far for nothing.

## Goals, Habits & Growth

I almost hit all my goals this year—I was only two short, and the ones I missed required me to step out of my comfort zone. I didn’t, and that’s okay. Those will be the first things I tackle in Q1 next year.

These past three months, I’ve learned so much about myself. Picked up some bad habits. Built some new ones. Started playing soccer again—I genuinely missed the thrill. Started learning how to swim. Became a better public speaker—I don’t get nervous anymore.

And I genuinely love my friends’ company. You guys know who you are.

## Closing Out School — A Long Time Coming

I’ll officially be done with school this week, and omg… it’s been a long time coming. My brother joked the other day, “Damn, how long you been in college now?” We laughed, because honestly… three schools later, I’ve done it all:

- Played two college sports - D1/D2
- Full scholarships
- Big-name internships
- Made real connections
- Built experiences people dream about

I still remember being stressed in high school, wondering if I’d even play college sports, how I’d afford anything, and dealing with everything going on around me.

Look at me now.

## A Quote That Hit Me This Year

“A key measure of intelligence is your success in achieving your desired outcomes in life, rather than academic scores or raw mental ability.” — Naval

So far, I’d say I’ve gotten everything I’ve wanted—not fully there yet, but I’m getting there. And I’m embracing the uncertainty along the way.

Ending this long-ass blog with this:

I’m excited for next year & post-grad life. A new chapter and I’m ready for it.

Also… Forbes 30 Under 30 came out today. I have 6 years 👀 We’ll see.`

    content: `# Public Draft with Yoni: Adding More Substack Features Because I’m a Copycat

Published on: September 3, 2025

I don’t really know what to say, but here we are. This is my first post testing out a Substack feature I’m adding. The idea came to me a couple of days ago—funny enough, from someone I saw on Instagram. At first, I thought, why even use Substack when I could just build my own platform? But I figured, why not? Sometimes you just have to start.

Right now, I’m sitting here with Yonathan (say hi, Yonathan). He’s not sure what to say either. Maybe that’s the point—this doesn’t have to be forced. It should flow naturally.

Yonathan’s Part

Earlier today, I went on a run and saw something that stuck with me: a father sitting at a playground, reading a book to his two daughters. It was such a simple scene, but something about it was beautiful. Little moments like that hit me and make me pause.

Back to Me

The rest of this is just me playing around. This post is really just a public draft, a way to test out the like button feature I just built. Nothing too serious, more like a public journal entry.

I’m building a startup, adding features, experimenting, and just seeing where this goes. Looking forward to writing more posts, sharing thoughts, and letting this space grow naturally.

Alright, peace out.

Published on: August 10, 2025

I just finished my J.P. Morgan internship. I did a lot of applied AI engineering—built something that's actually going into production to help the company work more efficiently with unstructured data. I wish I could share every detail of my experience, but due to policy, I can't talk about my job or what I built.

What I can say is that the last few months have changed my life in so many ways. I've grown a lot—enough to shift how I see certain things in life. I made so many friends this summer, and honestly, it feels like I've spent most of it just enjoying their company. I really value the people I'm close to now. It's something I don't take for granted. I love all my friends.

I'll try to post more blogs in the coming months since I'll have way more free time (only one class a week). A lot is happening behind the scenes, and I'll share more once I can officially talk about it.`

    content: `# All Gas, No Breaks: Back to the Grind

Published on: May 12, 2025

I don't even know how to put it into words… this year has been crazy. I've learned so much—probably more than I ever expected. I've been coding like a maniac lately—spending hours at my desk, grinding non-stop. Honestly, sometimes I get so locked in I forget to even work out (not great, I know). But when you're building things you care about, and bringing ideas to life? It's addicting.

And of course, shoutout to AI—it's changed the game completely. It's like I finally have the tools to make my ideas real, faster than ever.

Next month, I start my summer internship, and man… I'm beyond excited. New friends, new skills, a whole new world of learning and connecting. It feels like a major step forward, and I'm ready for it.

I just wrapped up the semester with all A's and B's, and while I'm proud of that, I'll be real—school's been feeling dry lately. A lot of what we're being taught feels outdated, especially in a world that's evolving so fast with AI. It's hard to stay engaged when most of the real learning is happening outside the classroom. I'm honestly just ready to graduate and move on.

I know I haven't posted in a few months, but I'm back. Back to the grind. This summer's about to be one for the books.

All gas. No breaks. Let's get it.`

    content: `# From Heartbreak to Hustle: Chasing My Goals & Going Viral

Published on: February 25, 2025

Life has been moving fast lately. A few weeks ago, I was dealing with heartbreak—trying to process everything and move forward. It wasn't easy, but I knew I had to shift my focus. Instead of dwelling on what I couldn't change, I turned my energy toward my goals. And now? Everything is falling into place in ways I never expected.

One of my biggest wins recently? TikTok. I started posting consistently, just experimenting and having fun, and then—boom—one of my videos hit over 120,000 views. Seeing those numbers climb was surreal. That moment made me realize how much potential this platform has. Now, I'm locked in, studying what works, refining my content, and building something bigger. This isn't just about going viral—it's about creating an impact, telling my story, and showing people what's possible.

At the same time, I'm still deep in the tech world, constantly learning and growing. Working on my website has been a game-changer. I've added new features, played around with AI tools, and pushed myself creatively in ways I never imagined. What once seemed like futuristic technology is now at my fingertips—helping me build, automate, and create like never before.

Right now, it feels like I'm at the start of something big. Everything I'm doing—whether it's content creation, tech projects, or personal growth—is setting me up for the future I want. This next year is critical for me, and I'm ready to make it my best one yet.

Here's to embracing change, betting on myself, and chasing every opportunity that comes my way. Let's get it. 🚀`

Wow, what a day! Today marked the inauguration of Donald Trump back into office. The next four years are sure to be interesting, and I can only hope that the changes ahead help me reach—and even exceed—my goals. This next year is especially critical for me, and I'm excited to see all the amazing things I'll achieve.

On another note, I've been learning so much while building this website. Thanks to AI, I've added a bunch of new features today. It's incredible how this technology has transformed my life. Growing up, I was always fascinated by AI, especially in movies. Now, seeing it become a reality is mind-blowing!

I'm so excited for what the future holds—for myself, for technology, and for the world. Here's to continued growth and endless possibilities!`
