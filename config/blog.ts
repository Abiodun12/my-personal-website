Published on: May 12, 2025

I don't even know how to put it into wordsâ€¦ this year has been crazy. I've learned so muchâ€”probably more than I ever expected. I've been coding like a maniac latelyâ€”spending hours at my desk, grinding non-stop. Honestly, sometimes I get so locked in I forget to even work out (not great, I know). But when you're building things you care about, and bringing ideas to life? It's addicting.

And of course, shoutout to AIâ€”it's changed the game completely. It's like I finally have the tools to make my ideas real, faster than ever.

Next month, I start my summer internship, and manâ€¦ I'm beyond excited. New friends, new skills, a whole new world of learning and connecting. It feels like a major step forward, and I'm ready for it.

I just wrapped up the semester with all A's and B's, and while I'm proud of that, I'll be realâ€”school's been feeling dry lately. A lot of what we're being taught feels outdated, especially in a world that's evolving so fast with AI. It's hard to stay engaged when most of the real learning is happening outside the classroom. I'm honestly just ready to graduate and move on.

I know I haven't posted in a few months, but I'm back. Back to the grind. This summer's about to be one for the books.

All gas. No breaks. Let's get it.`

Published on: February 25, 2025

Life has been moving fast lately. A few weeks ago, I was dealing with heartbreakâ€”trying to process everything and move forward. It wasn't easy, but I knew I had to shift my focus. Instead of dwelling on what I couldn't change, I turned my energy toward my goals. And now? Everything is falling into place in ways I never expected.

One of my biggest wins recently? TikTok. I started posting consistently, just experimenting and having fun, and thenâ€”boomâ€”one of my videos hit over 120,000 views. Seeing those numbers climb was surreal. That moment made me realize how much potential this platform has. Now, I'm locked in, studying what works, refining my content, and building something bigger. This isn't just about going viralâ€”it's about creating an impact, telling my story, and showing people what's possible.

At the same time, I'm still deep in the tech world, constantly learning and growing. Working on my website has been a game-changer. I've added new features, played around with AI tools, and pushed myself creatively in ways I never imagined. What once seemed like futuristic technology is now at my fingertipsâ€”helping me build, automate, and create like never before.

Right now, it feels like I'm at the start of something big. Everything I'm doingâ€”whether it's content creation, tech projects, or personal growthâ€”is setting me up for the future I want. This next year is critical for me, and I'm ready to make it my best one yet.

Here's to embracing change, betting on myself, and chasing every opportunity that comes my way. Let's get it. ðŸš€`

Wow, what a day! Today marked the inauguration of Donald Trump back into office. The next four years are sure to be interesting, and I can only hope that the changes ahead help me reachâ€”and even exceedâ€”my goals. This next year is especially critical for me, and I'm excited to see all the amazing things I'll achieve.

On another note, I've been learning so much while building this website. Thanks to AI, I've added a bunch of new features today. It's incredible how this technology has transformed my life. Growing up, I was always fascinated by AI, especially in movies. Now, seeing it become a reality is mind-blowing!

I'm so excited for what the future holdsâ€”for myself, for technology, and for the world. Here's to continued growth and endless possibilities!`
