# All Gas, No Breaks: Back to the Grind

Published on: May 12, 2025

I don't even know how to put it into words… this year has been crazy. I've learned so much—probably more than I ever expected. I've been coding like a maniac lately—spending hours at my desk, grinding non-stop. Honestly, sometimes I get so locked in I forget to even work out (not great, I know). But when you're building things you care about, and bringing ideas to life? It's addicting.

And of course, shoutout to AI—it's changed the game completely. It's like I finally have the tools to make my ideas real, faster than ever.

Next month, I start my summer internship, and man… I'm beyond excited. New friends, new skills, a whole new world of learning and connecting. It feels like a major step forward, and I'm ready for it.

I just wrapped up the semester with all A's and B's, and while I'm proud of that, I'll be real—school's been feeling dry lately. A lot of what we're being taught feels outdated, especially in a world that's evolving so fast with AI. It's hard to stay engaged when most of the real learning is happening outside the classroom. I'm honestly just ready to graduate and move on.

I know I haven't posted in a few months, but I'm back. Back to the grind. This summer's about to be one for the books.

All gas. No breaks. Let's get it.
