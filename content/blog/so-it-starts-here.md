# So It Starts Here…

Published on: August 10, 2025

I just finished my J.P. Morgan internship. I did a lot of applied AI engineering—built something that's actually going into production to help the company work more efficiently with unstructured data. I wish I could share every detail of my experience, but due to policy, I can't talk about my job or what I built.

What I can say is that the last few months have changed my life in so many ways. I've grown a lot—enough to shift how I see certain things in life. I made so many friends this summer, and honestly, it feels like I've spent most of it just enjoying their company. I really value the people I'm close to now. It's something I don't take for granted. I love all my friends.

I'll try to post more blogs in the coming months since I'll have way more free time (only one class a week). A lot is happening behind the scenes, and I'll share more once I can officially talk about it.
