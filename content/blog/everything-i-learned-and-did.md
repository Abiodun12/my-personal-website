# Everything I Learned & Did From September to December — In Real Time

Published on: December 2, 2025

Last time I posted on here was September 2… it feels like ages ago lol. Since then, I’ve done a lot, lived a lot, and honestly discovered a lot about myself in the process.

The first few weeks of September were me recapping my summer and everything that happened—meeting new friends, getting my return offer from JPMorgan, meeting the guys I’m building BrewU with, and realizing I was stepping into a major transition period of my life. I still am. I’m starting a new job next year, finishing school with basically one class a week, and I’m blessed to be in a position where I don’t have to work right now just to pay my bills. That alone is something I’m grateful for, and I know I can be privileged. It’s something I’ll never take for granted.

## San Francisco — One of the Best Moments of My Year

I got invited to a panel discussion in San Francisco, and at first, I was low-key nervous. Days before the event, I kept thinking, “What am I even going to talk about?” 😅 But I stayed optimistic, did my research, trusted what I knew, and flew out.

I landed in SF, grabbed lunch with friends, showered, took a nap—and afterward, I felt energized. Confident. Ready.

I talked about my life, my views, AI, my story. I’m glad people found it interesting and relatable. Keep in mind, this was over 300+ people staring at this kid with a mic. Afterward, people came up to me, DMed me, and even Braven wrote me a handwritten letter. (If you want to get to my heart… write me a letter. I keep everything.)

That moment made me realize something: I’m in a place where if I ever needed a job, I genuinely feel like the connections I’ve made would get me in rooms most people pray for. Some roles wouldn’t even require an interview. And that means I’m doing something right.

Spending a few days in SF made me think: maybe I should travel more. I loved the culture there. Maybe I’ll live there for a bit someday. But NYC and Chicago still have my heart.

## Finishing September — Becoming a Real Engineer

September ended with me doing something huge: I built an entire app from scratch, alone. A real app. Database, backend, scraping pipelines, AI integration, clean UI—everything.

Going into it, I was optimistic like I always am (my mom drilled that into me). Even my co-founder had doubts about whether I could pull something like this off, but safe to say, the MVP is basically finished.

And honestly? Building this app was easier than I expected. But I learned so much—like, I swear I feel like a senior engineer and I haven’t even started my full-time job yet 😂.

Next year already has me excited. There’s so much happening behind the scenes—not just BrewU. I see myself growing into more community/branding/product solutions. (Shh… can’t give it all away yet.)

## The Uncertainty of Life — Something I’m Finally Accepting

One thing that’s been on my mind lately is just how uncertain life is. I’ve always known that, but maybe because my mind has finally had time to settle and rest, I’m finally feeling the weight of it.

I was talking to one of my successful friends and she told me she struggles with the same thing sometimes—how everything you have can change in an instant. How nothing is guaranteed.

I’ve always lived by this: Control what you can control, and the rest will fall into place. But also… sometimes luck is involved. That’s just real.

I’ve accepted it. This is how life will always be. Life is complex. Predicting the future is impossible.

So I’m heading into the uncertainty head-on, enjoying the ride, and focusing on what I can control. It’s given me so much peace. I didn’t come this far for nothing.

## Goals, Habits & Growth

I almost hit all my goals this year—I was only two short, and the ones I missed required me to step out of my comfort zone. I didn’t, and that’s okay. Those will be the first things I tackle in Q1 next year.

These past three months, I’ve learned so much about myself. Picked up some bad habits. Built some new ones. Started playing soccer again—I genuinely missed the thrill. Started learning how to swim. Became a better public speaker—I don’t get nervous anymore.

And I genuinely love my friends’ company. You guys know who you are.

## Closing Out School — A Long Time Coming

I’ll officially be done with school this week, and omg… it’s been a long time coming. My brother joked the other day, “Damn, how long you been in college now?” We laughed, because honestly… three schools later, I’ve done it all:

- Played two college sports - D1/D2
- Full scholarships
- Big-name internships
- Made real connections
- Built experiences people dream about

I still remember being stressed in high school, wondering if I’d even play college sports, how I’d afford anything, and dealing with everything going on around me.

Look at me now.

## A Quote That Hit Me This Year

“A key measure of intelligence is your success in achieving your desired outcomes in life, rather than academic scores or raw mental ability.” — Naval

So far, I’d say I’ve gotten everything I’ve wanted—not fully there yet, but I’m getting there. And I’m embracing the uncertainty along the way.

Ending this long-ass blog with this:

I’m excited for next year & post-grad life. A new chapter and I’m ready for it.

Also… Forbes 30 Under 30 came out today. I have 6 years 👀 We’ll see.
